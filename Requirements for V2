Currently working on a planning apparatus (ERP)

Needs an API Exposed:
 - Documentation
 - Wanted API Calls:
    - Pull the data out of the machine
        - JSON format
        - CSV format with custom file name matching the serial number
    - Move the machine
    - Run single auto draw test
    - Calls for setting the calibration 

Phone is the primary device being used to interact with the machine 

Function:
 X Machine Calibration
 X Use the load calibration function
   - data out of the machine is calibrated/curve fitted 
   - input coefficients for the curve fit 
    - 3rd order polynomial
 X Calibration routine should be something like this:
    - Measure the weight, save the raw data
    - solve the polynomial and save the coefficients
X Save the raw data with the name/serial number
 - Save multiple runs 
 - Draw offset: 
    - brace height where the string touches the machine
    - for a 10 inch draw currently the data will say 0 to 10 should say 5 to 15 if the brace height is 5 inches
X Set the brace height in the calibration page
X Display when the machine is a the zero point
 - Change the default jog distance to .5 inches
 - Calibration feature to set the top speed of the machine 
    - input the inches per min


mechanical issues
 - Reaching 75 lbf loads
 - Making a side brace, machine leans when at full extension. 

Bug fix:
 - Machine load number is not as stable as we would like. 
 - Machine doesn't seem to like to hold its zero

improved jogging:
 - potential solution is to get the rotary dial working

Use the same interface for jogging.
